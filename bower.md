# BOWER

[https://bower.io/]()

the aim of using bower is to speed up the including of packages.

collectively adds packages under same folder - bower_components/

```
npm install -g bower
```

creates bower.json file

```
bower init
```

```
bower search PACKAGE
```

```
bower install PACKAGE --save
```

```
bower install
```

```
bower list
```

```
bower update <package>
```

```
bower update
```

```
bower uninstall <package>
```

### where to put the installed packages

create a file called .bowerrc (This file tells Grunt that the Bower components, when installed, should be placed here.)
