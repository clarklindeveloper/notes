# React Native

- React native compiles React views to native code
- JS code is not compiled to native code, it runs in a thread
- Expo vs React Native CLI? here we use Expo
- Expo Client App (helps during development) wraps your app or you can publish standalone apps

### React

- Managed by React Native Team / Community
- Barebone development (basic setup)
- no utility features
- full flexibility, integrates with any native code

### Expo

- Expo is 3rd party
- Managed App Development
- Conenience & Utility Features
- limited to Expo Ecosystem
- https://expo.io/learn

```
npm install expo-cli --global
```

### Create the project

```
expo init my-new-project
cd my-new-project
expo start
```
