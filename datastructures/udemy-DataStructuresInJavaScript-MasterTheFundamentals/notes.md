## Array vs List
### Array
* fixed size
* array created by specifying size
* you write to an array with a[index]=value
* you read from an array with x = a[index]

### List
* no fixed size
* created empty, then values added to it
* add to list with l.add(value)
* read from list with x = l.get(index)

## Common array iterations

* dont use arbitary value to keep track or low or high
* "sample the data" use values from the array to set the limits
