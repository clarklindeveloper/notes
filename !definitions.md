## ACTIONSCRIPT (AS)

Definition:

Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript]()

ActionScript is an Object-oriented programming language. It is a dialect of ECMAScript.

### Actionscript 1.0 (AS1)

    (It was based on JavaScript. ActionScript 1.0 is a loosely-typed language.)
    AS1 - is prototype based, as there are no classes or OOP constructs

### Actionscript 2.0 (AS2)

    (move towards bringing ActionScript closer to an Object-Orientated Language)

### Actionscript 3.0 (AS3)

    developed by Adobe, is an open source, object-oriented programming (OOP) language.
    AS3 was written when ES4 specifications were still being written, it diverged, it conforms to ES4 (see below), but goes beyondâ€¦

    AS3 is the more feature rich language.

    AS3 has:
    * Class and inheritance
    * Object-Oriented programming, encapsulation
    * Functions have access modifiers: public, private, protected, internal
    * arguments have a type
    * functions have return type
    * Maps using Objects, Dictionary, weak-Keys
    * default parameters
    * typing (which is what Typescript tries to solve for JS)
    * invisible until addChild() called and added to display list;

## JAVASCRIPT (JS)

Javascript is a dialect of ECMAScript.  
Javascript versions of interest:

- ES3 (1999), (most people know this version of Javascript) is more like AS1, has regular expression support
- ES4 (never released),
- ES5 (2009), current version of javascript supported by most modern browsers, supports JSON
- ES6/ES2015 (2015), more advanced way to code JS based on ES6 standards (some browsers support this version) - classes and inheritance - scopped variables 'let', - object literal improvements - arrow functions, - default parameters - spread operator ... - promises, - modules - no type - no 'private' access modifier, can immitate with scopped variables. - Set(), Map(), WeakSet(), WeakMap() - iterators, generators
- ES7/ `**` operator, Array.includes()
- ES8/ES2017 (2017), latest version of EMCA Script (still unsupported by many browsers)
- ES9 (2018)
- ES10 (2019)
