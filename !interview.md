[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview]()

An interview is a conversation where questions are asked and answers are given.
Interviews can happen in a wide variety of contexts:

### Employment

Interviews in an employment context are typically called job interviews which describe a formal
consultation for the purpose of evaluating the qualifications of the interviewee for a specific position. [8]
Interviews are seen as a useful tool in assessing qualifications.

The telephone interview is often used as an initial candidate screening method.
Typically, candidates who "pass" the phone interview portion are offered a face-to-face interview.

There are a number of reasons why employers like to conduct phone interviews before bringing candidates into the
office. Below are six specific things an interviewer may be looking for.

1. Fill in missing information or clarify details.
2. Determine whether you have the right qualifications.
3. Find out how interested you are in the position.
4. Assess how good of a communicator you are.
5. Decide if they can afford you.
6. Figure out how well you would fit within the company.

Technical interviews are common amongst employers recruiting for engineering, science or I.T. roles.

Essentially, it’s an interview to assess your technical ability, usually related to the technical knowledge required for the role and the organization you wish to work for.

### WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS WILL I BE ASKED IN A TECHNICAL INTERVIEW?

The likelihood is that most of the technical questions in the interview will relate directly to the job role.  
Therefore, you can get a good idea of what questions they might ask you from the job advert.

Most job descriptions will specify a set of essential technical skills and, rather than take your word for it, they’ll want to see those skills and knowledge in action.

All in all, during a standard technical interview they might expect you to complete a task, such as coding, or they might ask questions that test how you would use your technical knowledge in a real-life situation.
